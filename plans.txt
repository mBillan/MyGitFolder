The develop took from the master.
Meanwhile the master branch have changed.
Let us see what happens!!


How to add you changes to the repo:
	git commit -m "Initiating my first git folder"
	git remote add origin https://github.com/mBillan/MyGitFolder.git
	git push -u origin master




absr sho lseere!! msh zabet
Zabat!! haha3


From time to time we need to sync the master branch with the origin branch by "git pull" and after this we can push from master.
Ok so how can I manage a develop branch>?!!!1
